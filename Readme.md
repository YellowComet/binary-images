# Binary Images generation

Small sample program to transform images to black/white grids.

## Running the code
To run the code, first you'll have to download it and install the needed dependencies. For that, you can follow the next steps:

```bash
git clone repository-url
cd BinaryImages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After this, you can run the main.py script selecting the image you want to process. 

Original images must be stored in `data/original_images/` folder, while processed images are saved by the program in `data/processed_images/` folder.
